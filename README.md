# Arthur Tools

We have some tools that we developed originally for [Project Arthur](https://github.com/harrystech/arthur-redshift-etl)
and then they appeared to more generally useful. So here they are.

## Deploying CloudFormation templates



## Deploying Lambdas


## Centralized logging

Our ELK stack is really Elasticsearch + Lambda + Kibana where we use Lambdas to pull in logging information from Lambdas, Services, and Applications.
